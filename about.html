        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p> The Association of International Students in Azerbaijan is a non-
            political student organization representing the interests of all
            
            international students enrolled in the University. Its aims and
            objectives are to promote and assist the welfare, social,
            educational and cultural activities of international students and to
            promote goodwill and understanding amongst international
            students.
        <br>
        <br>
            We are a student-led association that supports and connects
            international students from a wide variety of countries studying in
            Azerbaijan. We are dedicated to promoting diversity and to
            establishing international relationships with the international
            student community. We intend to organize events and cultural
            experiences with the help of sponsors that not only engage the
            international student community but the host community as well.
        <br>
        <br>
            Azerbaijan is being left out in the world student platform. We
            seek to unite all foreign students in Baku under the umbrella of
            the Association of International Students in Azerbaijan. We will
            present new suggestions about student policy to appropriate
            bodies, create close relations with international and regional
            student organizations.</p>
